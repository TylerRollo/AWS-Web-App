# AWS-Web-App

***This is my first attempt at an AWS hands-on project***

This project uses multiple AWS services: **AWS Amplify** to host the frontend, **API Gateway** to manage API requests, **AWS Lambda** for backend logic, **DynamoDB** for data storage, and **IAM** for managing permissions and access control.
